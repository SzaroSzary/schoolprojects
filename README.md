# schoolprojects

I've added almost all of my school projects. Most of them are quite chaotic, but that's how my learning process looked like ;) Languages and libraries used to create them are various. I thought about rewriting them to make them look nice and clear, but I realized, that it's pointless. Through all these years I've learnt how NOT to code and these projects show my biggest mistakes. Weird variable names, huge function blocks and big mess... But every mistake brought me closer to more clear, more transparent and more efficient code, so it was worth it. At least I think it was ;)
