By Lewis Mitchell



	This PPM was designed to satisfy the needs of all Windows users
who have said to themselves - "I wish I could feed a rocket into the 
demon spawn who created this filth." Well now you can!
	It is my first model so some things are a little below par. Now 
that I know what is going on I might attempt something a little more
complex.

DESCRIPTION:

	Bill Gates model for Quake2. His weapon is a briefcase.

BUILDTIME:

of time frigging around with stuff that turned out to be pretty simple.
